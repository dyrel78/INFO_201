## Summary Report
A brief summary of the content and findings of your work. You should also document any assumptions or issues, and explain any significant design decisions.

You only need to document assumptions that you have made, i.e., you donâ€™t need to restate assumptions already explicitly stated in this specification. Note that you canâ€™t use assumptions to negate or nullify something that is explicitly stated in the specification.




## Use Cases

### ID

UC-[unique number to identify this use case]

### Title

[Provide a short title that indicates the goal of the use case, preferably as a short, active verb phrase, e.g., "Lend Item".]

### Description

[Briefly describe the goal and context of this use case. This is usually an expanded version of what you entered for the "Title" above. It doesn't need to be long or detailed.]

### Primary Actor

[The main person or external system that interacts with your system to achieve the goal of this use case.]

### Secondary Actors (if applicable)

[A list of additional people or external systems required to achieve the goal of this use case.]

### Preconditions (if applicable)

[Describe the state your system is expected to be in before this use case can proceed. For example, before the library use case "Lend Item" (Lecture 6, slide 24) can proceed, the item(s) to be loaned must be available and the patron must have a valid library membership.]

### Main Success Scenario

[Describe the most common way to accomplish the goal of the use case. This description can either be in narrative form or a numbered list (1..N) of specific steps. When a use case has more than one way to accomplish the goal, the most common way is shown here, i.e., only a single path is shown. For example, in the library use case "Return Item", the most common way to accomplish the goal would be for the patron to return the item before the due date.]

### Alternative Success Scenarios (if applicable)

[Describe alternatives to, or deviations from the main success scenario that still accomplish the goal of the use case. For example, in the library use case "Return Item", an alternative way to accomplish the goal might be for the patron to return the item after the due date, thus incurring a fine (which is a distinct use case in itself).]

### Exceptions (if applicable)

[Describe situations that could prevent successful completion of the use case, and corrective actions that could be taken. For example, in the library use case "Return Item", the patron may have forgotten to bring the item with them.]

### Other

[Anything else that you think is relevant ðŸ˜„, such as related use cases not already mentioned elsewhere.]
