# Summary and Scope of the System

The client, HV Lo-Fi, is looking to establish an online store to complement its successful brick-and-mortar stores, which sell records, tapes, headphones, and accessories. 




The key users of the system are the sellers who will be creating and listing their products, and the buyers who will be browsing and purchasing items. Additionally, the system will also be used by administrators who will be responsible for managing and maintaining the platform.

The broad areas of functionality for the system include product listing and management, user account management, shopping cart and checkout processes, search and filtering capabilities, and a messaging system for buyers and sellers to communicate. The system will also feature an integrated payment gateway to facilitate secure and convenient transactions. Overall, the new system aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for both sellers and buyers, while promoting the growth of the handmade and artisanal goods market.
